The third Homework Assignment for CS-406

This assignment required the creation of two views:\

**Strongly Typed View**
  - A strongly typed view is a view that is created for the user by intellisense that has little in terms how how it is customized.
    It usually follows the format of whatever intellisense says it should.
    
and 

**Dynamic View**
  - A dynamic view is a view that is created and customised by the user. 
    This just means that the user must input the code for how they wish for the view to look.
